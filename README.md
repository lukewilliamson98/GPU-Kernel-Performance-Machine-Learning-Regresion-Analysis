# GPU-Kernel-Performance-Machine-Learning-Regresion-Analysis
In this project, a GPU kernel performance dataset was cleaned, machine learning regression algorithms were run on it, and the algorithms were analyzed.

To view the project in a nice format, please open Regression.pdf

If you'd like to run the code yourself, download the R markdown file and run each chunk sequentially.

If your computer has a lot of processing power processing power, change 10000 in the line:
df <- df[sample(1:nrow(df), 10000, replace=FALSE,]
